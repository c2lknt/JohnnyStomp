                    <p>For Matt Wells.  He and I took a very slooow bus from Boulder Colorado to NYC.  He saw a pretty girl in a truck stop and decided he wanted to stay with her in Nebraska forever.</p>
                    <p>I actually had to trick him to get him back on the bus, but he was super drunk so it was easy.  I was super drunk too so that made it harder.</p>
                    <p>He ended up writing a nice little book of poems about it.  I wrote this silly song about it.  My song is filled with lies but the video description revealed the truth of it so everything has turned out ok.</p>

                    Again, no metaphor here.  We used to go hang out by the railroad tracks and drink and talk.  I suppose this song could've been about any of those people, but in reality, it was Stoo Peck I was looking for at the time.

                    This song actually is a metaphor.  Or is it?  Actually, I don't think it is, I just changed my friends name, as a SO SUBTLE reference to Wesley Willis, who, like my friend, was frequently suffering because of schizophrenia.
